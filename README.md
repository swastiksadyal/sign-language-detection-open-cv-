# sign-language-detection-open-cv-
i tried to make a sign language detection by opencv and python tensorflow.
firstly the data was taken locally from my computer totrain a local network which became as the prototype of the upcoming network.
the model was trained on google colab and you can get the trained and built model on the google collab as well.

# Open Cv

open cv was used to get the data to train the network as well as to predict the network response
the open cv capture method was used on already trained and saved model in keras ".h5" format
